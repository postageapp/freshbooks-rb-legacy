# FreshBooks Legacy API Wrapper

This is provided as a legacy fill for applications using the old FreshBooks
library which uses the `FreshBooks` namespace.

To avoid conflicts with newer libraries that use the same name, it is now
called `FreshBooksLegacy`.

## Warning

Newer applications should bind against the [official library](https://github.com/elucid/ruby-freshbooks)
and avoid using this.

## Copyright

This is a historical version of the [freshbooks.rb](https://github.com/bcurren/freshbooks.rb)
project by Ben Curren and Ben Vinegar. Very minimal modifications have been
made.
